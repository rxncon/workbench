<h1>rxncon - the reaction-contingency language</h1>

<p>rxncon ("reaction-con") is a framework to build, visualise and model cellular signal transduction networks.  </p>

<p>The rxncon language makes it easy to formalise detailed mechanistic knowledge on cellular signal transduction. The language is computer readable, and the rxncon compiler can convert the knowlede base into a range of graphical and executable outputs. </p>

<p>We are inspired by the comprehensive wall charts - and later genome-scale models - that revolutionised our understanding of cellular metabolism. With rxncon, we strive to make the same possible for cellular signal transduction.</p>

<p>We finalised a major overhaul of the language, the interpretation engine and the export features and are happy to present
	rxncon 2.0, the second generation rxncon language with an increased expressiveness and precision. </p>

<p>A model formulated in the rxncon language is a knowlede base. The knowledge can be visualised in a range of graphical formats, or compiled into executable models. We have developed a parameter-free simulation logic that can be used for network validation and qualitative simualtion. Alternatively, the network can be converted into a rule-based model that requires parametrisation before simulation. The higher level "biological" language and multiple compilation targets make it easier to develop models. Automatic visualisation - with layout reuse - and model generation greatly facilitate an iterative model development - visualisation - validation process. </p>
