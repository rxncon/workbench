<p>rxncon is a framework to build, visualise and model cellular signal transduction networks. The rxncon language
    enables the description of these networks. The rxncon software tool interprets the rxncon language and automates
    export into a range of graphical and mathematical formats. The purpose of rxncon is to provide a framework to
    collect, visualise and model experimental data on cellular networks. In the rxncon framework, cellular signal
    transduction networks are described at the same granularity as empirical data. The key feature is strict separation
    of elemental reactions from contingencies. Elemental reactions are generic reactions, and the contingencies define
    contextual constraints these reactions. This separation minimises the combinatorial complexity. The user defines
    the network as one reaction list and one contingency list. From these data mathematical and graphical representation
    can be generated. The network can be modified and extended iteratively, and both visualisation and mathematical
    models can be generated automatically at any time. </p>
