<p> Network reconstruction in biology is an iterative process to formalise the structure of a biological network,
    reflecting our current knowledge. While reconstruction methods for metabolic networks are well established,
    only few reconstruction methods exist for cellular signal transduction networks. Furthermore, reconstruction
    of signalling networks is challenging, because state combinations lead to a large number of specific states,
    generating highly complex structures. </p>

<p>To address this issue, we developed the rxncon-language, that enables a systematised and condensed reconstruction of
    cellular system by separating the reconstruction into reactions (rxn) and contingencies (con). It largely avoids the
    combinatorial problem by describing the network on the same granularity as the biological findings, but creates a
    gap between the reconstruction and established modelling methods.</p>

<p>For this purpose we developed a framework interpreting the rxncon-language and translating the reconstruction into
    mathematical models or visualisations. The user defines the network with one reaction list and one contingency list.
    From these data mathematical and graphical representation can be generated. The network can be modified and extended
    iteratively, and both visualisation and mathematical models can be generated automatically at any time.</p>

<p>We finalised a major overhaul of the interpretation engine and the export features and are happy to present rxncon
    2.0, the second generation rxncon language with an increased expressiveness and precision. </p>
