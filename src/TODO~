first online version: file system, matrix ( contingencie and interaction), graphs (not the first 3 but the other three, no filters) with reuse of coordinates
projects should consist of system files but also show graph definitions, when they were once created
if edited in cytoscape, the layout and xggml file changes. this new layout information should be addable anyhow to the project in rxncon. Like this you dont use your work in layoutin
when updating file use other project as tempalte from where i take the coordinates, reference file
like when i merge projects
project path should be displayed
every project gets subdirectories for each filetype
placeholders for other stuff "under development"
