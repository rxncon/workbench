        <p> - The rxncon language is a scalable and composable approach to build mechanistic models of signal
                    transduction.</p>
        <div id="par_1">
            <a class="btn btn-link" role="button" style="float: none;margin-top: -15px;">
                <span class="button-text">Read more</span>
            </a><br />
            <div style="display: none" class="hidden_text">
                <p> Signal transduction is characterised by state changes in components. In experiments, we measure these variables - 
				or <i> elemental states </i> - as modifications at specific residues or bonds between pairs of components.
				Single components may have many elemental states that, much like switches, can be combined into many specific
				configuarations or <i> microstates</i>. Most modelling formalisms use a microstate-based description, leading
				both to a combinatorial complexity and an ambiguity in the relationship between experiments (elemental states)
				and model (microstates) that get worse the larger the model scope (in terms of elemental states) is.
				Furthermore, microstates are moving targets, as they depend on the elemental states the model considers,
				meaning that changes to a microstate model tend to have far-reaching consequences. </p>
				
				<p> By describing the network in terms of (combintions of) elemental states, the rxncon language gives the model
				the same resolution as empirical data. This both minimises the (unnecessary) complexity and maximises the congruence
				between experiment and model. Furthermore, elemental states do not depend on each other, making the rxncon language
				highly composable. This makes it much easier to update, extend and merge rxncon models, and greatly facilitates the iterative and
				cooperative work that is required to build models at the genome scale. </p>

        <p> - Building a rxncon model is writing down molecular biology. This process is straightforward when the biology is
            well known.</p>

            <div style="display: none" class="hidden_text">
                <p> rxncon is a higher level "biological" language that is <i> compilable </i> instead of <i> executable </i>.
				This makes the language intuitive to use, as the rxncon network is built by statments such as: 
				"Kinase X phosphorylates Target Y" or "Kinase X phosphorylates Target Y only when Kinase X is
				phosphorylated on Residue Z". The first statement is an <i> elemental reaction</i>: This statement only defines a
				possibility, Kinase X can phosphorylate Target Y, without stating when this reaction can happen.
				The second statement is a <i> contingency</i>, constraining the reaction statement by specifying a necessary context,
				in this case the phoshorylation at an activating residue. More complex requirements can be defined by Boolean
				combinations of elemental states, making it possible to define arbitrarily complex requirements.
				Hence, the model can be made as complex as data requires, but does not need to be more complex.

				<p> Building a rxncon model means making very specific statements about molecular biology. We define which reactions
				are known to be possible (in the <i> reaction list</i>) and what we know about the conditions they are active
				under (in the <i> contingency list</i>). Each statement must be made in terms of elemental states, making them
				both highly specific and directly related to (possible) experiments. A carefully built and well annoated model
				therefore constitute a high-quality knowledge base - which can be visualised or used as a template for (automatic)
				model generation.

			<p> We developed <i> the rxncon compiler </i> to compile the higher level "biological" language into executable model code
			or graphical formalisms. The compilation is automatic and can use different options depending on target. Currently, we
			support the following compilation targets: <i> Rule-based models </i> in the BioNetGen language, a parameter-free and mechanistic
			<i> bipartite Boolean formalism</i>, the <i> reaction graph </i> to visualise the reaction topology, the <i> elemental
			species-reaction graph </i> to visualise the complete regulatory structure, and the <i> regulatory graph </i> for a condensed
			visualisation of the regulatory structure (omitting neutral states). The graphical compilation targets can reuse previous layout,
			minimising the cost for iterative network extension, visualisation and model creation. </p>

				<p> The <i> rxncon workbench </i> makes it even easier to work with rxncon. It 
				combines a local model repository - with versioning - with the tools for visualisation and model creation.
				Model versioning simplifies model development: When the model file is changed and uploaded again, the
				active file gets overwritten but the old file gets stored and can be accessed anytime. There is in other words
				no reason to have multiple files for the same model. The rxncon workbench can be installed directly from the 
				Python package index through "pip install rxncon_workbench". </p>
